### Species data
#### Occurrence data
Species data are extracted from the GBIF ([gbif.org](https://www.gbif.org)) database. The records are checked against the knows distribution of each pest in CABI ([cabi.org](https://www.cabi.org)) database. Six spcies had occurrence data in GBIf including Scirpophaga excerptalis, Sesamia grisescens, Chilo infuscatellus, Eumetopina flavipes, Yamatotettix flavovittatus and Perkinsiella saccharicida.

#### Background sample

To model the species presence-only data with statistical models a random sample of background data is extracted from the landscape of interest. To take to account for the possible observation bias in the occurrence data we used a bias layer which was a fucntion of accibility and proximity to all observed locations.


### Species distribution modelling

There are only few records per species, so we used a Hierarchical Generalized Additive Model (**HGAM**; Pearson et al. 2019) with Point Process weighting (Fithian & Hastie 2013) to increase the predictive power of the model.
