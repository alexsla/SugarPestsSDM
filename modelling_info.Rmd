## Species data
### Occurrence data
Species data are extracted from the GBIF ([gbif.org](https://www.gbif.org)) database. The records are checked against the knows distribution of each pest in CABI ([cabi.org](https://www.cabi.org)) database.


### Background sample
The model the species presence-only data with statistical models a random sample of background data is extracted from the landscape of interest. To taken to account for the possible observation bias in the occurrence data we used a bias layer. The bias layer is created by a density estimation of species Target Group, known as TGB, as described by Valavi et al. (2021), here the data for the *genus* of all species. The TGB data are cropped to the study are and records outside of this area is discarded.

## Species distribution modelling
The records are low ...

A Hierarchical Generalized Additive Model (**HGAM**; Pearson et al. 2019) with *point process weighting* (Fithian & Hastie 2013) was used to model the species.
